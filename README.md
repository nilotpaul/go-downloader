# Go Downloader

Allows downloading files from multiple providers.

# Motivation

Needed a downloader for my HomeLab which can also download private GDrive files.

# Note

Only google provider has been added for now, will add more in future.
Not sure how will multiple downloaders be handled, so its kinda only supports GDrive currently.

# Run

DEV - in 3 seperate terminals run air, make css, make templ
PROD - make
